# 🔬 Multi-Scale Breast Cancer Diagnostic AI
This repository contains a Deep Learning pipeline and interactive web dashboard for classifying breast cancer histopathology images. It utilizes a custom **Multi-Scale Attention Architecture** built on top of ResNet50 to analyze tissue slides across four different magnifications (40X, 100X, 200X, 400X) simultaneously.

### 🏆 Model Performance
Tested on a strictly isolated, unseen test split of the **BreaKHis v1 Dataset**:
* **Accuracy:** 99.00%
* **ROC-AUC:** 0.998
* **Malignant Recall:** 99.00% (Critical for minimizing false negatives in medical diagnostics)

SETUP:-
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

Bash
git clone [insert repo link]
cd breakhis-multiscale-attention


Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
For Windows:
Bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
For Mac/Linux:
Bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Step 3: Install Dependencies
With your virtual environment activated, install the required packages:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you may want to install the CUDA-specific version of PyTorch from their official website for much faster inference).

Step 4: Download the Pre-Trained Weights
Because Deep Learning weight files are too large for standard GitHub tracking, they are hosted in the Releases tab.

Go to the Releases tab on this GitHub page.

Download the file named best_multiscale_model.pth.

Move that file into the v1_multiscale_attention/models/ folder on your computer.

Steps for Training from Scratch-
If you want to train the model yourself or experiment with the architecture:

Get the Data: Download the official BreaKHis v1 Dataset.

Reorganize: Place the raw data in a data_raw/ folder and run python reorganise_dataset.py to structure it perfectly for the data loader.

Train: Navigate to the v1_multiscale_attention folder and run:

Bash
python src/train.py
This will apply on-the-fly data augmentation, execute a strict 70/15/15 train/val/test split, and trigger Early Stopping if the validation loss plateaus.
4. Evaluate: Once training finishes, check your metrics by running:

Bash
python src/evaluate.py
